## How to run a .sem file?

### 1: Code

First off, write a .sem code. I don't even understand yet what it should look like, so figure it out for yourself.

### 2: Interpreter

Then, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/tinarao/semka.git
```

### 3: Run!

`py main.py main.sem`

So, format is simple:

```
py main.py <filename>.sem
```
